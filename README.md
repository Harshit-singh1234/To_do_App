# To-Do List

 <h1>Introduction</h1>
 
  I've always used to-do lists, and since I didn't knew what to do as my first independent Dart/Flutter project, I've chosen to create my
own to-do list app, so, here it is. It's very simple, but it helped me to understand and put into practice a lot of things, that before this project, I've had only learned thorugh theory or coding along with courses.
