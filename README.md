# todo_appp_project

##Introduction
I've always used to-do lists, and since I didn't knew what to do as my first independent Dart/Flutter project, I've chosen to create my own to-do list app, so, here it is. It's very simple, but it helped me to understand and put into practice a lot of things, that before this project, I've had only learned thorugh theory or coding along with courses.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
